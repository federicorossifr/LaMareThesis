\section*{\centering{Abstract}}
\paragraph{}
Nowadays it's very important to monitor sensitive environments like glaciers in order to keep track of climatic changes or particularly dangerous weather conditions. To pursue this goal, automatic weather station (AWS) are employed. The term "automatic" refers to the ability of the station to remain active nearly without the action of an operator, using energy harvesting techniques to power its components.
\paragraph{}
The AWS used on the glacier of La Mare is a data logging capable device that sends glacier's environment measurements to a remote server via satellite communication. Then data are redirected to a FTP server, from which they're retrieved,elaborated and represented in a web application. The system has been operative for a few years until January 2015, when data from the device stopped to be sent.
\paragraph{}
The main goal of this work is to analyse the system in order to obtain more knowledge about it to build a documentation for future maintenance and upgrades of the system and re-deploy the system connectivity on the glacier.
