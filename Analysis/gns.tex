\subsection{GSN Web Application }
\paragraph{What is a GSN \cite{cll1}}
A Global Sensor Network (GSN) is a web framework that provides an abstraction layer capable of retrieve data from nearly any kind of sensor/logger and present it in various forms such as chart or human readable tables.
\paragraph{Virtual Sensors}
From this point of view, every device can be abstracted to a virtual sensor that processes data source inputs and produces an output stream. A virtual sensor can be defined in a XML configuration file where following informations are specified:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Output structure
	\item Set of data input streams containing data source informations
\end{itemize}
In \cite{cll1} there is the configuration of La Mare virtual sensor, as shown in appendix \ref{appendix:vsensor}
\paragraph{The FTP Wrapper}
The system described before produces data into a FTP Server, so it's necessary to provide a wrapper that encapsulates data received into the GNS standard data model. Then application logic produces output stream as a row of an SQL table.
