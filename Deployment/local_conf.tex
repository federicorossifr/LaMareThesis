\subsection{Configuring device into local Loggernet (or PC200W)}
\paragraph{}
Connection in local environment is accomplished by a serial RS232 serial connection. While PC200W is distributed as free software, Loggernet is offered both in a paid version and a 30-day trial version. PC200W can be downloaded from \cite{cs1}. Loggernet trial version can be downloaded from \cite{cs2}
