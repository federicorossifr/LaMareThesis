\subsection{Deploying GSN on Linux-Windows host}
\paragraph{Prerequisites} GSN module has the following dependencies:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Java: JDK and JRE.
	\item Apache Ant for source compilation.
	\item MySQL Server.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Source code} GSN source code can be downloaded from: link
\paragraph{Pre-configuration} With a MySQL client create the user {\tt gsn} protected by the password {\tt gsnpassword}. 
Re-open connection with that user and create the database {\tt gsn}. This is the default storage configuration contained in {\tt gsn-dev/conf/gsn.xml}
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=left, breaklines=true]
<storage user="gsn" password="gsnpassword" driver="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver" url="jdbc:mysql://localhost/gsn" />
\end{lstlisting}
\paragraph{Running GSN} Open a command prompt on the project root {\tt gns-dev} and execute 
{\tt ant gsn} to compile and execute the application. Test the application in a web browser at the link
{\tt http://127.0.0.1:22001}. You should see the main page showing pre-configured virtual sensors.
